    Find the number closest to n and divisible by m
    Given two integers n and m. The problem is to find the number closest to n and divisible by m. If there are more than one such number, then output the one having maximum absolute value. If n is completely divisible by m, then output n only. Time complexity of O(1) is required.

    Constraints: m != 0

    We find value of n/m. Let this value be q. Then we find closest of two possibilities. One is q * m other is (m * (q + 1)) or (m * (q â€“ 1)) depending on whether one of the given two numbers is negative or not.
